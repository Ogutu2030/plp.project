Database Design:

This involves creating a schema or blueprint for the database, defining tables, columns, relationships, and constraints.

A good design ensures data consistency, reduces redundancy, and supports efficient queries.

Key steps include:

Identifying entities (tables) and attributes (columns).

Establishing relationships between entities (e.g., one-to-many or many-to-many).

Defining primary and foreign keys to ensure unique identification and table linking.

Normalization:

Normalization is the process of organizing data to reduce redundancy and improve integrity.

It involves dividing a table into smaller tables and defining relationships between them.

Key forms include:

1NF (First Normal Form): Ensures each cell contains a single value, and rows are uniquely identifiable.

2NF (Second Normal Form): Builds on 1NF and removes partial dependencies, where non-key attributes depend on part of a composite primary key.

3NF (Third Normal Form): Eliminates transitive dependencies, ensuring attributes are directly dependent only on the primary key.
